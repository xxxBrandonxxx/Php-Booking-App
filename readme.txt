You are approached by a client that is planning on launching a new website which takes information from various hotels and allows users to make a comparison of rates based on the amount of days a user wishes to stay at those hotels.

As a result the user must be able to input the following data,

 

First name: Required

Surname: Required

Email address : Required

NB Number of days must be greater than 0

Check-in date : Required

Check-out date : Required

Hotel : Required

 

The form must have frontend validation the site must be responsive and the backend must make use of OOP, contributing to a modular and maintainable codebase.

Each hotel should have a different daily rate. This daily rate should be used to calculate the total cost and must be displayed inside the correct column.

For example:

You are booking The Commodore Hotel

Number of days: 3

Daily Rate: R350

Total: R1050.00

COMPARE (button)

When the user clicks the Compare button, the data entered is not lost but is carried through to the next screen. On the next screen the user is presented with a  comparison of the two hotels next to each other with all of their features listed including Pool, bar, kid friendly etc as well as the difference in rates.

At this stage the user is then able to select either Hotel A or Hotel B and presented with a Book button

When the user clicks the Book button an email will be populated which will contain the user's choice and all user details for the Hotel Bookings Manager to follow up on.
